    .env for environment variable management
    File System for data storage
    UUID for generating unique task IDs

Features

    User Authentication: (Optional) User registration and login to manage personal tasks.
    Task Status: Toggle between "unfinished" and "done" status for each task.

Database Setup

This application uses a JSON file for data storage
The tasks data is stored in a local tasks.json file within the backend project directory. This JSON file acts as a simple storage mechanism.
No database setup is required. Just ensure the tasks.json file is available in the backend directory.

Customization

    You can change the JWT secret, port, or other settings in the .env file.
    Adjust the routes, models, and controllers as needed to fit the application's requirements
